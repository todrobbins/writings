# Tetrahedral heavens
_5 March 2017_
```
Tetrahedral heavens have their dense ontogenies,
  but you are a spark
    shot out through the expanse

You gleam on the edge of your vector,
  a brilliant
    eternal
      pulse

Reenter matter,
  spirit now flesh,
    flesh as ash

Who kept time?
You still burn hot in the hearts of kin,
  a spark shot out into the expanse
```
