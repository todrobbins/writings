```
You hold a substantial bottle of Gatorade between your thighs and all I can think about is: how did your fingernails grow that long?

You have gentle penmanship, yes, I’m observing you paint your innermost thoughts and emotions into your notebook.

We’re both passengers on a train that is taking us somewhere. That’s nice, isn’t it?

Now they’re all standing around us and they likely have little idea how long you’ve skillfully carried that bottle of crimson red.
