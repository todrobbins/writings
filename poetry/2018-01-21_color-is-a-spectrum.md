# Color is a spectrum _(draft)_
_21 January 2018_
```
Color is a spectrum
  and so are you.

You project multitudes
  and can be interpreted
    or resisted and refracted

Lasers speak in color,
  seemingly a single point of light,
    but in the world as endless streams
      of information encoded in spectra.

That is you: endless streaming spectra
  and I love you for it all
    and all is you.
```
