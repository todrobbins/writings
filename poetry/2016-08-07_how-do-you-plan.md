# How Do You Plan for a Future That Has Never Been?
_16 July 2017_
```
How do you plan for a future that has never been?
I have never been here before
I am a pioneer, within me a solo trail
Unexpected outcomes will surely be,
Though some evidence precedes me
To plan a future that has never been
```
