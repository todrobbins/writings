# Gateways to the ancients are ivory tusks
_May 2006_
```
Gateways to the ancients are ivory tusks
Hewn up as sentinels——awaiting keywords
And the day burns at ease.
Ancestral congregations looming lightly
Though anxious for lighting.
Their sturdy witness, coupled to authorization,
Cure the ill philosophies that lingered.
These are waiting at the gates of celestial glories.
