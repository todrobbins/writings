The ancient councils
Of Gods without end
The work of our Father:
To bring to pass the eternal lives of men
Ascending planes and dominions that have no peak
Though a dark spirit would chain the weak
Children of The Holy Parents burst the bands of the fallen,
With the aide of their Messiah,
Then sit enthroned in the Kingdom of Heaven
