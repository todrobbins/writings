# From sin to dawn
_27 April 2008_
```
Crippling grasp, a lot like ice,
  pacified my resolve.

My outstretched hand,
  locked in place,
    chilled,
    and full of shadows,
      was graced by a ray.

Dark obstructions broke into mosaics
  and I felt the surface of my skin break out into the shout of spring.

Freed from atrophy,
  I shook a hand in front of my own,
    his hand knew the crosses of lives with names
      and it set a blaze on the surface
        of the now-bursting rise of light.
