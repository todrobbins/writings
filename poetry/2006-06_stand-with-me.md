# Stand with me by these mountains
_June 2006_
```
Stand with me by these mountains,
And you will feel the Spirit burning.
The bush is burning, the sea is turning,
Towards the Light of Heaven.
Sit with me on the hillside field.
He fed five thousand children.
They believed Him when He told them.
He was the Bread of Life.
Rise with me when He calls us,
Out of the telestial towards His realm.
When He comes again,
Eternity expands,
Skies become fire,
And hearts are white stones
