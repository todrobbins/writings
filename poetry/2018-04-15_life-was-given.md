# Life was given
_15 April 2018_
```
Life was given
a chance to breathe in
to exhale
and to rest
calmly on water
and silently on the wind.

God saw,
watching erudite and wide-eyed,
and let life on its way
and life left God to brood.

Generations of time
and the orbits of stars
passed by the gaze of God,
but I remained fixed
in my coexistence,
in eternity,
in life,
and God saw that
I was good.
