# Guns to kill
_22 July 2012_
```
Guns to kill and guns that kill
  Or is it a human that kills with humans to kill?
  Violence for violence or violence for airwaves?

I can only shake with monstrous grief at the thought of grey blood in the light of muzzle flashes, aisle blood flowing over my senses.

Guns made for forcing entropy’s reign in the lone and dreary world.
