# Lodged in memory
_16 July 2017_
```
“Lodged in memory,”
  do you know what that means?
    Scared?
    Anchored?
    A hearth in a home?

My thoughts turn to the instantiated,
  the nestled, cradled calm of a memory
  once received.

The memory, at first tenant
  now lord
  is seated,
  lodged.

But what does that mean?
