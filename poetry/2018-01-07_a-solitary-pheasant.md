# A solitary pheasant
_7 January 2018_
```
A solitary pheasant stood in the pasture,
While frost bit the morning.

I drove my car past and wondered what it meant.

“Some times we stand alone,” I thought.

Baby will come into a world where solitude is unlikely,
But full of estrangement,
And love.

Love will win out,
If only because the sun will always rise above the Wasatch,
And me with it. 
```
