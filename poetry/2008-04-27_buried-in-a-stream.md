# Buried in a stream of thought
_27 April 2008_
```
Buried in a stream of thought,
  God's thought,
    we see bread and water
      as giving hands and savior's blood

Hands are wet with anticipation
  and minds baptized by renumeration

As we rise from those glowing waters,
  our heads and hands are covered
    in the name of God

Intellects afire and spirits reshaped,
  the stream carried on as we carried
    strife and ire

We bathe often at the stream,
  kneeled in heart,
    like smooth stones
```
