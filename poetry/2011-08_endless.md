# Endless
_August 2011_
```
You are seated on pine
and sway with the beach grass.

Floating, you rock the porch swing
with thoughts of shoreline ebb and flow.

“We are like these waves,” you say.
As I pull you close with my weathered hand,
you continue, “We have also struggled against the moon,
and have likewise carved our memories
into the boundaries of this world.”

“True,” I say,
“Our marks were through adversity,
dances on the immensity of time.”

Our eyes are tired now,
perhaps weak with age,
but eyes that have waited
for the lapping of fluid gold
on the cusp of millennial sunset.
