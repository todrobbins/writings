# Tubes of metal
_29 August 2011_
```
Tubes of metal streamed through cloudy skies
laced with gold

Green signs, grey tables, the amber notice
and a gate closed my day––
my bright sea eclipsed by wood-filled cliffs
and fluid steel

“Pay as you leave”
Privileged to be mobile
but cursed to a loop
that smears the meaning
of my freedom
```
