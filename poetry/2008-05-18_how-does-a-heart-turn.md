# How does a heart turn?

How does a heart turn?

Like a world?

Like a leaf?

Life is turning the pebbles in my heart-stream.
They roll and glide with unknowable matter
Through veins and cavities—the river-road.
Sometimes I walk on that water and the infant stones play rhythms on my soles.
I sway by chest wind and nod at the memory of lilies.
They twisted and moseyed with me at the roadside water’s edge.

Xin committed to following the river-road round seventy times:
I believe this is how a heart can turn.
