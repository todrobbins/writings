# Bread, water, blood
_26 November 2017_
```
Bread, water, blood, and flesh
Are consumed each day before I rest.

Light in the day
And shadow by night,
I give up trying to fight.

But fighting myself in my dreams,
I hope to wake
And start anew.

Each day
I run to you;
I hold out hope
That light will come
Before I rest.
```
