# Word heaven sent to heart and tongue
_2 July 2006_
```
Word heaven sent to heart and tongue
Fills the channels, fills the lungs
Escapes the mouth to ears nearby
The Spirit enters these and testifies:
 “Believe My agent now present
And hold fast to my Son’s atonement,
Thus preparing for future ordination.”
These words are sealed by confirmation.
