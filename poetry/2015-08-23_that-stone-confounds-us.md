# That Stone Confounds Us
_23 August 2015_
```
That stone confounds us
We, the postmodern,
see the chocolate swirls
on geologic time,
not what once showed on its face
Eons and ages passed until
farm folk held that smooth stone
near fields, forests, wells, and mines
That stone confounds us,
discomposes our art,
stuns our texts,
our present
