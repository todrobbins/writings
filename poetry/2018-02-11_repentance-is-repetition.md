# Repentance is repetition
_11 February 2018_
```
Repentance is repetition,
learning to love yourself
as much as a sunrise,
as a mother's kiss,
or a warm smile
given
freely.

Repeating penance,
learning to silence
self deprecation,
I lower my eyelids
to raise my eyes
to heaven.

I can see
infinite iterations
of myself,
yearning for other worlds
better than my own.
```
