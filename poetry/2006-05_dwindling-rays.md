# Dwindling rays of a joyous countenance
_May 2006_
```
Dwindling rays of a joyous countenance
Yet light the eyes in a foreboding abyss
His heart bursting with metallic rattle
And his sound overbearing her subtle disconnections
The sun now out and the river stemmed by the dam
He awaits the rising ocean
