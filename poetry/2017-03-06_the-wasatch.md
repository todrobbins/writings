# The Wasatch
_6 March 2017_
```
The Wasatch was blanketed by clouds of unknowing
  and the valley was blown away
    by wind,
      that wound north to south
        to west to
          the power’s out!

Batteries ghosted and one flashlight remained.
Gas stoves and neighborhood grief
  were met by a singular hymn
    and blown away
      by wind,
        wound through our unknowing

One year without power
  but the sun did rise
    above the Wasatch
```
