# The eve of the Lord
_August 2011_
```
The eve of the Lord Jesus Christ:
Born into a world of injustice and vice
Stars shining in the east,
Light years of peace reign in time and space

The day of the Lord Jesus Christ
is clothed in crimson matter,
Zion descending in pillars of light

Let heaven ring wild bells
as earth receives the master of might
```
